        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Scampi are tiny crustaceans with pale pink shells, not much unlike their shrimp relatives that many of us are so familiar with. In the United States, Italian cooks have replaced the scampi with shrimp, but decided to include both in the dish's name.</p>
        <p>This classic dish has a simple galic, white wine, and butter sauce base and pairs well with pasta, though you can substitute the pasta with rice if you'd prefer. Whichever you choose, just be sure to cook the shrimp just long enough to make them turn pink all over, but not so long that their bodies curl into rounds with a rubbery texture!</p>
